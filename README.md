# Top-Down_Console
Snake Console Game
---------------------
This was a group project where each member was responsible for creating a different application; one on Windows Console (C++), one as a Java Application, one as a Database and one as a Basic Website.
I chose to be responsible for the Windows Console application, and aimed to replicate the classic Snake game.
After reopening the project, some references have seen to be corrupt so I edited the #include to match the correct route, however, it still seems corrupt.
